# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Contribution Workflow

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ai.uclaacm.com! ❤️

Here's a quick guide on how to get started.

1. Either make a new branch or a fork of this repository. `main` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
2. Follow the instructions in "Development Setup" above. If you're on a fork, replace the URL with the fork's URL; if you're on a different branch, check it out using `git checkout`.
3. Beep boop away!
4. **Before you push**, make sure your app runs with `yarn start`. If there are any errors, our CI/CD service will **reject your build**.
5. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes!
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/uclaacm/ai.uclaacm.com/pulls) with your changes, and let someone on your project team know.
   a. Netlify has a neat feature called "Deploy Previews" that give you a link to preview your changes; [see the blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) for more info!
7. If your code passes code review, then we can **squash and merge** it into `main`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch/fork.
